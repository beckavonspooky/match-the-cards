## Description
* Match the Cards is a card game of speed and memory. 
* Players can test their skills by clicking the cards randomly to finding the cards match before the clock runs out. 
* My memory game is a single player game, and immerses the player in audio and visual designs from one of my favorite films Beetlejuice.

[Click To Play!](https://beckavonspooky.github.io/match-the-cards/)
* The player begins the game by clicking on the start button.
* Once the start button is clicked, a 30 second timer will start to count down. 
* Audio effects intensify the experience as the timer counts down.
* The player can then click on any card on the board to reveal a character from the film.
* Once the first card is flipped, the player may select a second card to flip to match.
* If the cards are a match, they will stay face up.
* If the cards are not a match, the will flip over to allow the player to try to match again.
* Once the timer stikes 0, Beetlejuice will appear to take them to the otherside.
* The player can then click the “Play Again” button to try their luck once more.
