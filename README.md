## Description
Match the Cards is a card game of speed and memory. Players can test their skills by clicking the cards randomly to finding the cards match before the clock runs out. 
My memory game is a single player game, and immerses the player in audio and visual designs from one of my favorite films Beetlejuice.

## Getting Started

// insert wireframe: game in progress //

The player begins the game by clicking on the start button.
Once the start button is clicked, a 30 second timer will start to count down. 
Audio effects intensify the experience as the timer counts down.
The player can then click on any card on the board to reveal a character from the film.
Once the first card is flipped, the player may select a second card to flip and reveal the character.
If the cards are a match, they will stay face up.
If the cards are not a match, the will flip over to allow the player to try again to find the match again.
The player must match all the pairs before the timer runs out.
Once the timer stikes 0, Beetlejuice will appear to take them to the otherside.
The player can then click the “Play Again” button to try their luck once more.
